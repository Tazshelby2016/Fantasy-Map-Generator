# Fantasy Map Generator â€“ Namebase version


Azgaar's _Fantasy Map Generator_ is a free client-side web application generating interactive and highly customizable SVG maps based on Voronoi diagrams. This version, started by Tazshelby2016, focuses on the Namebase generator and the default Namebases, aiming to increase the accuracy of generated names and the default namebase. Changes within the original program will be added as much as possible.
